      <h2>Turning Undelivered Mail Into Opportunity</h2>
      <p>We’re setting up vending machines to sell undelivered post — reducing waste, creating curiosity, and preventing items from being deleted forever.</p>

    <h2>Our Business Model</h2>
    <p>
      Each year, a vast number of parcels go unclaimed or undelivered. Instead of being destroyed or discarded, these items are given a second life through <strong>Name</strong>.
      We work directly with logistics partners to collect and process these parcels, preparing them for redistribution through our network of automated vending machines.

        <h3>1. We Collect</h3>
        <p>We acquire undelivered items that are legally cleared for resale, preventing unnecessary waste.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>2. We Restock</h3>
        <p>Each parcel is repackaged and placed in vending machines across public locations and transportation hubs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>3. You Discover</h3>
        <p>Customers purchase a mystery parcel — every purchase supports sustainability and circular reuse.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for <strong>Name</strong> came from a simple question — what happens to all the undelivered mail that never finds its way home?
      After learning that much of it is destroyed, we wanted to create a system that benefits everyone: logistics companies, the environment, and curious customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as an experimental concept has grown into a sustainable model, combining recycling, innovation, and a touch of mystery.
      Every vending machine represents a small step toward a more circular economy — and a fun surprise for anyone who participates.
